# Virtual-Self-Driving-Car
The car can take rounds from bottom-right corner of the screen to the top-left corner of the screen whilst avoiding the obstacles
which are generated through touch-down.
Virtual Car is made using kivy. It slows down when it comes across sand so it learns that it has to avoid sand since on
not doing so it will slow down and eventually stop.
